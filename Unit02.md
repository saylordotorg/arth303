**Unit 2: The Abbasid (750-1258) and Seljuk (C. 1040-1157) Dynasties and
Islamic Art and Architecture in the Maghrib** <span id="2"></span> 
*This unit examines the art and architecture of the Abbasid and Seljuk
dynasties and the regional rulers of Anatolia and the Maghreb.  The unit
begins by looking at the distinctive artistic and architectural style
formulated under the Abbasid Caliphate that spread throughout the rest

culture, and artistic traditions of the Islamic world.  Finally, the
unit concludes by looking at Islamic art and architecture in the Maghreb

comprehensive understanding of major artistic and architectural
innovations of the Abbasids and Seljuks and regional developments in
Islamic architecture in Anatolia and the Maghreb.*
