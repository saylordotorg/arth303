**Unit 5: The Art and Architecture of the Safavid (1501-1722), Ottoman
(ca. 1299–1922), and Mughal (1526-1858) Empires** <span id="5"></span> 
*This unit focuses on the art and architecture of three later Islamic
Empires: the Safavids, Ottomans, and Mughals.  It begins by focusing on
Safavid city planning and manuscript illumination and then outlines
major developments in Ottoman art and architecture. Then, we will
examine the art and architecture of the Mughal Empire, focusing on the
construction of Fatehpur Sikri, Shahjahanabad, the Taj Mahal, and Mughal
miniatures. The unit concludes by concentrating on the role that trade
and diplomacy between these Empires and Europe, Russia and China played
in the development of Safavid, Ottoman, and Mughal art and
architecture.  After completing this unit, you should have a
comprehensive understanding of the artistic and architectural traditions
of the Safavid, Ottoman, and Mughal Empires and the major cultural and
visual exchanges that occurred between these three Islamic Empires,
Europe, Russia, and China.*
