**Unit 1: Early Islamic Art and Architecture of the Umayyad Period
(632-750)** <span id="1"></span> 
*This unit focuses on the core beliefs of Islam and the early
development of Islamic art and architecture during the Umayyad period
and later in Spain.  It begins with an overview of Islamic beliefs,
early Islamic history, and the general characteristics of Islamic art
and architecture.  The unit then traces the development of Islamic art
and architecture under Umayyad patronage and their adoption and
adaptation of pre-Islamic artistic and architectural traditions.  The
unit concludes by looking at Islamic art and architecture in Spain after
the last member of the Umayyad dynasty fled and established his capital
at Córdoba.  After completing this unit, you will have a comprehensive

of Islamic art and architecture, particularly under the Umayyads and
later regional developments in Spain.*
