This course serves as an introduction to the pre-modern Islamic artistic
traditions of the Mediterranean, Near East, and Central and South Asia. 
This course is organized around the major dynasties under which Islamic
art and architecture were produced.  The first unit surveys core Islamic
beliefs, the basic characteristics of Islamic art and architecture, and
art and architecture created under the patronage of the Umayyads
(632-750) and the Muslim rulers of Spain.  The second unit focuses on
the artistic and architectural innovations of the Abbasids (738-1250)
and Seljuks (c.1040-1157), as well as the regional rulers of Anatolia
and the Maghreb.  The third unit looks at the art and architecture of
three successive Islamic dynasties based in Egypt: the Fatimids
(909-1171), Ayyubids (1171-1250), and Mamluks (1250-1517)**.** Unit 4
examines the art and architecture of the Ilkhanid (1256-1353) and
Timurid (c. 1370-1507) dynasties in Iran and Central Asia.  The final
unit presents the art and architecture of three later Islamic Empires:
the Safavids (1501-1722), Ottomans (ca. 1299–1922), and Mughals
(1526-1858).  These three later Islamic empires shared diplomatic ties
and participated in active trade and cultural exchange with each other
as well as Europe and East Asia. After completing this course, the
student will be familiar with the major tenets of Islam, general Islamic
history, the relationship of both to major developments in Islamic art
and architecture, and the exchange of artistic and architectural forms
throughout the larger Islamic, Mediterranean, Asian, and African worlds.
