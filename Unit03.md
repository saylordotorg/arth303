**Unit 3: Art and Architecture of the Fatimid (909-1171), Ayyubid
(1171-1250), and Mamluk (1250-1517) Dynasties** <span id="3"></span> 
*This unit focuses on the art and architecture of three successive
Islamic dynasties whose empire was based in Egypt: the Fatimids,
Ayyubids, and Mamluks.  We will first learn about the building of Cairo
by the Fatimid rulers, their patronage of the decorative arts, and the
production of Tiraz textiles.  We will then turn to the Ayyubid madrasas
and other building projects as well as Ayyubid patronage of the
decorative arts.  This unit concludes by examining later Islamic art and
architecture in Egypt under the Mamluk dynasty.  After completing this
unit, you should have a comprehensive understanding of the artistic and
architectural traditions of these three Islamic Egyptian dynasties. *
